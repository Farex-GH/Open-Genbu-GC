FIRMWARE

- Pretty-fy files
    - Some of the USB stuff could be improved on a bit, and deviated from what
      the Pi Foundation wrote.
    - dpad vs button press handling could be done better. Probably a generic
      struct with fields that describe which parts of the USB descriptor they
      modify.
        - This is hard because of how dpad values need to be set in the USB
          packet.

- Use USB CDC for LED configuration
    - Depends if Switch is okay with composite devices
    - Also needs some sort of protocol to parse user input for how LEDs are
      handled
    - Might be abandoned unless I have free time

- Make LEDs and USB happen on the same core.
    - It's doable, just don't be lazy.

REPOSITORY

- Organize things better
